# FuseAI

An AI-powered agent builder that lets users describe a workflow in plain English and automatically generates, deploys, and monitors custom API agents.

## Overview

FuseAI analyzes natural language requests, designs REST APIs, selects Zapier integrations, generates FastAPI code from templates, and deploys running agents with monitoring, error handling, and a testing playground.
